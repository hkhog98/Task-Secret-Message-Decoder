# Task-Secret-Message-Decoder

This C program is designed to decode a secret message hidden within a text file encoded by shifting each character forward by three positions in the alphabet. The program prompts the user to input the path to the encoded file and specific offsets where encoded characters are located. It then decodes the characters, overwrites the encoded characters with the decoded ones directly in the file, and displays the decoded message.

## Requirements

To compile and run this program, you need:
- A C compiler (e.g., gcc)
- Linux environment (or other Unix-like systems)
